# Welcome to my blog!

This is a sample blog post created using Astro's content collections feature. Content collections provide a powerful way to manage and query your content with full TypeScript support.

## Features of Content Collections

- Type-safe frontmatter
- Automatic validation
- Easy querying with `getCollection()`
- Built-in sorting and filtering

Content collections make it easy to build blogs, documentation sites, and other content-driven applications with Astro.
